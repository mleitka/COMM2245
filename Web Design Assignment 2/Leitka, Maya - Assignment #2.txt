Profile

My name is Maya Leitka and this year I am a senior here at UNM. My major is Sociology and I have two minors in Psychology and Professional Writing. After I graduate, I am hoping to enter the social work field and write and create media for local non-profit organizations here in New Mexico. I’ve taken UX classes that mention web design, but never got into specifics. Now and going into the future, basic web design will be an essential skill to have for any field, especially when dabbling in digital media.

Interests

In my free time, I play video games and I’ve been trying harder to read more books (especially fiction). I also am a part-time dog walker and pet sitter, which has been so amazing and I’ve been able to meet so many wonderful people and pets through it! Attached is a picture of my own two dogs who are so special to me.
